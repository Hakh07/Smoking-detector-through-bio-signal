# Smoking Detection through Bio-Signals using Machine Learning
## Overview
This was a university group project focused on predicting whether a person smokes or not using various machine learning models based on their health-related bio-signals. We applied Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Machines to analyze which physiological features were most predictive.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## What I Did
- Implemented the Random Forest and SVM models
- Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset (normalization, encoding, outlier removal)
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Created visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves

## Results & Insights
- Random Forest achieved ~83.1% accuracy
  - Top features: Haemoglobin, GTP, Gender
- SVM achieved ~73.1% accuracy using RBF kernel
  - More resistant to overfitting, but lower precision and recall compared to Random Forest

## My Role
While this was a collaborative effort, I was primarily responsible for:
- Implementing and tuning the Random Forest and SVM models
- Data preprocessing and evaluation
- Generating performance metrics and visual analysis

## How to Run
Clone the repo and run the notebook using Jupyter.
